This project is about 0x02-temporal_difference
0-monte_carlo.py - Write the function def monte_carlo(env, V, policy, episodes=5000, max_steps=100, alpha=0.1, gamma=0.99): that performs the Monte Carlo algorithm:
env is the openAI environment instance
V is a numpy.ndarray of shape (s,) containing the value estimate
policy is a function that takes in a state and returns the next action to take
episodes is the total number of episodes to train over
max_steps is the maximum number of steps per episode
alpha is the learning rate
gamma is the discount rate
Returns: V, the updated value estimate

1-td_lambtha.py - Write the function def td_lambtha(env, V, policy, lambtha, episodes=5000, max_steps=100, alpha=0.1, gamma=0.99): that performs the TD(λ) algorithm:
env is the openAI environment instance
V is a numpy.ndarray of shape (s,) containing the value estimate
policy is a function that takes in a state and returns the next action to take
lambtha is the eligibility trace factor
episodes is the total number of episodes to train over
max_steps is the maximum number of steps per episode
alpha is the learning rate
gamma is the discount rate
Returns: V, the updated value estimate

2-sarsa_lambtha.py - Write the function def sarsa_lambtha(env, Q, lambtha, episodes=5000, max_steps=100, alpha=0.1, gamma=0.99, epsilon=1, min_epsilon=0.1, epsilon_decay=0.05): that performs SARSA(λ):
env is the openAI environment instance
Q is a numpy.ndarray of shape (s,a) containing the Q table
lambtha is the eligibility trace factor
episodes is the total number of episodes to train over
max_steps is the maximum number of steps per episode
alpha is the learning rate
gamma is the discount rate
epsilon is the initial threshold for epsilon greedy
min_epsilon is the minimum value that epsilon should decay to
epsilon_decay is the decay rate for updating epsilon between episodes
Returns: Q, the updated Q table
