This project is about 0x00-q_learning
0-load_env.py - Write a function def load_frozen_lake(desc=None, map_name=None, is_slippery=False): that loads the pre-made FrozenLakeEnv evnironment from OpenAI’s gym:
desc is either None or a list of lists containing a custom description of the map to load for the environment
map_name is either None or a string containing the pre-made map to load
Note: If both desc and map_name are None, the environment will load a randomly generated 8x8 map
is_slippery is a boolean to determine if the ice is slippery
Returns: the environment

1-q_init.py - Write a function def q_init(env): that initializes the Q-table:
env is the FrozenLakeEnv instance
Returns: the Q-table as a numpy.ndarray of zeros

2-epsilon_greedy.py - Write a function def epsilon_greedy(Q, state, epsilon): that uses epsilon-greedy to determine the next action:
Q is a numpy.ndarray containing the q-table
state is the current state
epsilon is the epsilon to use for the calculation
You should sample p with numpy.random.uniformn to determine if your algorithm should explore or exploit
If exploring, you should pick the next action with numpy.random.randint from all possible actions
Returns: the next action index

3-q_learning.py - Write the function def train(env, Q, episodes=5000, max_steps=100, alpha=0.1, gamma=0.99, epsilon=1, min_epsilon=0.1, epsilon_decay=0.05): that performs Q-learning:
env is the FrozenLakeEnv instance
Q is a numpy.ndarray containing the Q-table
episodes is the total number of episodes to train over
max_steps is the maximum number of steps per episode
alpha is the learning rate
gamma is the discount rate
epsilon is the initial threshold for epsilon greedy
min_epsilon is the minimum value that epsilon should decay to
epsilon_decay is the decay rate for updating epsilon between episodes
When the agent falls in a hole, the reward should be updated to be -1
Returns: Q, total_rewards
Q is the updated Q-table
total_rewards is a list containing the rewards per episode

4-play.py - Write a function def play(env, Q, max_steps=100): that has the trained agent play an episode:
env is the FrozenLakeEnv instance
Q is a numpy.ndarray containing the Q-table
max_steps is the maximum number of steps in the episode
Each state of the board should be displayed via the console
You should always exploit the Q-table
Returns: the total rewards for the episode
