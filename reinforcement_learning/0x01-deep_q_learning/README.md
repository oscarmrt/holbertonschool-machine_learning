this project is about 0x01-deep_q_learning
train.py, play.py - Write a python script train.py that utilizes keras, keras-rl, and gym to train an agent that can play Atari’s Breakout:
Your script should utilize keras-rl‘s DQNAgent, SequentialMemory, and EpsGreedyQPolicy
Your script should save the final policy network as policy.h5
Write a python script play.py that can display a game played by the agent trained by train.py:
Your script should load the policy network saved in policy.h5
Your agent should use the GreedyQPolicy
