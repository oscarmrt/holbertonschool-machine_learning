This project is about 0x02. Tensorflow
0-create_placeholders.py - Write the function def create_placeholders(nx, classes): that returns two placeholders, x and y, for the neural network:
nx: the number of feature columns in our data
classes: the number of classes in our classifier
Returns: placeholders named x and y, respectively
x is the placeholder for the input data to the neural network
y is the placeholder for the one-hot labels for the input data

1-create_layer.py - Write the function def create_layer(prev, n, activation):
prev is the tensor output of the previous layer
n is the number of nodes in the layer to create
activation is the activation function that the layer should use
use tf.contrib.layers.variance_scaling_initializer(mode="FAN_AVG") to implement He et. al initialization for the layer weights
each layer should be given the name layer
Returns: the tensor output of the layer

2-forward_prop.py - Write the function def forward_prop(x, layer_sizes=[], activations=[]): that creates the forward propagation graph for the neural network:
x is the placeholder for the input data
layer_sizes is a list containing the number of nodes in each layer of the network
activations is a list containing the activation functions for each layer of the network
Returns: the prediction of the network in tensor form
For this function, you should import your create_layer function with create_layer = __import__('1-create_layer').create_layer

3-calculate_accuracy.py - Write the function def calculate_accuracy(y, y_pred): that calculates the accuracy of a prediction:
y is a placeholder for the labels of the input data
y_pred is a tensor containing the network’s predictions
Returns: a tensor containing the decimal accuracy of the prediction

4-calculate_loss.py - Write the function def calculate_loss(y, y_pred): that calculates the softmax cross-entropy loss of a prediction:
y is a placeholder for the labels of the input data
y_pred is a tensor containing the network’s predictions
Returns: a tensor containing the loss of the prediction

5-create_train_op.py - Write the function def create_train_op(loss, alpha): that creates the training operation for the network:
loss is the loss of the network’s prediction
alpha is the learning rate
Returns: an operation that trains the network using gradient descent

6-train.py - Write the function def train(X_train, Y_train, X_valid, Y_valid, layer_sizes, activations, alpha, iterations, save_path="/tmp/model.ckpt"): that builds, trains, and saves a neural network classifier:
X_train is a numpy.ndarray containing the training input data
Y_train is a numpy.ndarray containing the training labels
X_valid is a numpy.ndarray containing the validation input data
Y_valid is a numpy.ndarray containing the validation labels
layer_sizes is a list containing the number of nodes in each layer of the network
actications is a list containing the activation functions for each layer of the network
alpha is the learning rate
iterations is the number of iterations to train over
save_path designates where to save the model
Add the following to the graph’s collection
placeholders x and y
tensors y_pred, loss, and accuracy
operation train_op
After every 100 iterations, the 0th iteration, and iterations iterations, print the following:
After {i} iterations: where i is the iteration
\tTraining Cost: {cost} where {cost} is the training cost
\tTraining Accuracy: {accuracy} where {accuracy} is the training accuracy
\tValidation Cost: {cost} where {cost} is the validation cost
\tValidation Accuracy: {accuracy} where {accuracy} is the validation accuracy
Reminder: the 0th iteration represents the model before any training has occurred
After training has completed, save the model to save_path
You may use the following imports:
calculate_accuracy = __import__('3-calculate_accuracy').calculate_accuracy
calculate_loss = __import__('4-calculate_loss').calculate_loss
create_placeholders = __import__('0-create_placeholders').create_placeholders
create_train_op = __import__('5-create_train_op').create_train_op
forward_prop = __import__('2-forward_prop').forward_prop
You are not allowed to use tf.saved_model
Returns: the path where the model was saved

7-evaluate.py - Write the function def evaluate(X, Y, save_path): that evaluates the output of a neural network:
X is a numpy.ndarray containing the input data to evaluate
Y is a numpy.ndarray containing the one-hot labels for X
save_path is the location to load the model from
You are not allowed to use tf.saved_model
Returns: the network’s prediction, accuracy, and loss, respectively
