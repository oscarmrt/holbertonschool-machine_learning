3-one_hot.py - Write a function def one_hot(labels, classes=None): that converts a label vector into a one-hot matrix:
The last dimension of the one-hot matrix must be the number of classes

4-train.py - Write a function def train_model(network, data, labels, batch_size, epochs, verbose=True, shuffle=False): that trains a model using mini-batch gradient descent:
network is the model to train
data is a numpy.ndarray of shape (m, nx) containing the input data
labels is a one-hot numpy.ndarray of shape (m, classes) containing the labels of data
batch_size is the size of the batch used for mini-batch gradient descent
epochs is the number of passes through data for mini-batch gradient descent
verbose is a boolean that determines if output should be printed during training
shuffle is a boolean that determines whether to shuffle the batches every epoch. Normally, it is a good idea to shuffle, but for reproducibility, we have chosen to set the default to False.
Returns: the History object generated after training the model

learning_rate_decay is a boolean that indicates whether learning rate decay should be used
learning rate decay should only be performed if validation_data exists
the decay should be performed using inverse time decay
the learning rate should decay in a stepwise fashion after each epoch
each time the learning rate updates, Keras should print a message
alpha is the initial learning rate
decay_rate is the decay rate

8-train.py - Based on 7-train.py, update the function def train_model(network, data, labels, batch_size, epochs, validation_data=None, early_stopping=False, patience=0, learning_rate_decay=False, alpha=0.1, decay_rate=1, save_best=False, filepath=None, verbose=True, shuffle=False): to also save the best iteration of the model:
save_best is a boolean indicating whether to save the model after each epoch if it is the best
a model is considered the best if its validation loss is the lowest that the model has obtained
filepath is the file path where the model should be saved
