This project is about 0x0A. Object Detection
0-yolo.py - Write a class Yolo that uses the Yolo v3 algorithm to perform object detection:
class constructor: def __init__(self, model_path, classes_path, class_t, nms_t, anchors):
model_path is the path to where a Darknet Keras model is stored
classes_path is the path to where the list of class names used for the Darknet model, listed in order of index, can be found
class_t is a float representing the box score threshold for the initial filtering step
nms_t is a float representing the IOU threshold for non-max suppression
anchors is a numpy.ndarray of shape (outputs, anchor_boxes, 2) containing all of the anchor boxes:
outputs is the number of outputs (predictions) made by the Darknet model
anchor_boxes is the number of anchor boxes used for each prediction
2 => [anchor_box_width, anchor_box_height]
Public instance attributes:
model: the Darknet Keras model
class_names: a list of the class names for the model
class_t: the box score threshold for the initial filtering step
nms_t: the IOU threshold for non-max suppression

outputs is a list of numpy.ndarrays containing the predictions from the Darknet model for a single image:
Each output will have the shape (grid_height, grid_width, anchor_boxes, 4 + 1 + classes)
grid_height & grid_width => the height and width of the grid used for the output
anchor_boxes => the number of anchor boxes used
4 => (t_x, t_y, t_w, t_h)
1 => box_confidence
classes => class probabilities for all classes
image_size is a numpy.ndarray containing the image’s original size [image_height, image_width]
Returns a tuple of (boxes, box_confidences, box_class_probs):
boxes: a list of numpy.ndarrays of shape (grid_height, grid_width, anchor_boxes, 4) containing the processed boundary boxes for each output, respectively:

box_confidences: a list of numpy.ndarrays of shape (grid_height, grid_width, anchor_boxes, 1) containing the box confidences for each output, respectively
box_class_probs: a list of numpy.ndarrays of shape (grid_height, grid_width, anchor_boxes, classes) containing the box’s class probabilities for each output, respectively

Displays the image with all boundary boxes, class names, and box scores (see example below)
Boxes should be drawn as with a blue line of thickness 2
Class names and box scores should be drawn above each box in red
Box scores should be rounded to 2 decimal places
Text should be written 5 pixels above the top left corner of the box
Text should be written in FONT_HERSHEY_SIMPLEX
Font scale should be 0.5
Line thickness should be 1
You should use LINE_AA as the line type
The window name should be the same as file_name
If the s key is pressed:
The image should be saved in the directory detections, located in the current directory
If detections does not exist, create it
The saved image should have the file name file_name
The image window should be closed
If any key besides s is pressed, the image window should be closed without saving
