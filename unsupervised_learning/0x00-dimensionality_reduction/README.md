This project is about 0x00. Dimensionality Reduction
0-pca.py - Write a function def pca(X, var=0.95): that performs PCA on a dataset:
X is a numpy.ndarray of shape (n, d) where:
n is the number of data points
d is the number of dimensions in each point
all dimensions have a mean of 0 across all data points
var is the fraction of the variance that the PCA transformation should maintain
Returns: the weights matrix, W, that maintains var fraction of Xâ€˜s original variance
W is a numpy.ndarray of shape (d, nd) where nd is the new dimensionality of the transformed X

1-pca.py - Write a function def pca(X, ndim): that performs PCA on a dataset:
X is a numpy.ndarray of shape (n, d) where:
n is the number of data points
d is the number of dimensions in each point
ndim is the new dimensionality of the transformed X
Returns: T, a numpy.ndarray of shape (n, ndim) containing the transformed version of X
