This project is about 0x00-pandas
0-from_numpy.py - Write a function def from_numpy(array): that creates a pd.DataFrame from a np.ndarray:
array is the np.ndarray from which you should create the pd.DataFrame
The columns of the pd.DataFrame should be labeled in alphabetical order and capitalized. There will not be more than 26 columns.
Returns: the newly created pd.DataFrame

1-from_dictionary.py - Write a python script that created a pd.DataFrame from a dictionary:
The first column should be labeled First and have the values 0.0, 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5
The second column should be labeled Second and have the values one, two, three, four
The rows should be labeled A, B, C, and D, respectively
The pd.DataFrame should be saved into the variable df

2-from_file.py - Write a function def from_file(filename, delimiter): that loads data from a file as a pd.DataFrame:
filename is the file to load from
delimiter is the column separator
Returns: the loaded pd.DataFrame

3-rename.py - Complete the script below to perform the following:
Rename the column Timestamp to Datetime
Convert the timestamp values to datatime values
Display only the Datetime and Close columns

4-array.py - Complete the following script to take the last 10 rows of the columns High and Close and convert them into a numpy.ndarray

5-slice.py - Complete the following script to slice the pd.DataFrame along the columns High, Low, Close, and Volume_BTC, taking every 60th row

6-flip_switch.py - Complete the following script to alter the pd.DataFrame such that the rows and columns are transposed and the data is sorted in reverse chronological order

7-high.py - Complete the following script to sort the pd.DataFrame by the High price in descending order

8-prune.py - Complete the following script to remove the entries in the pd.DataFrame where Close is NaN

9-fill.py - Complete the following script to fill in the missing data points in the pd.DataFrame:
The column Weighted_Price should be removed
missing values in High, Low, Open, and Close should be set to the previous row’s Close value
missing values in Volume_(BTC) and Volume_(Currency) should be set to 0

10-index.py - Complete the following script to index the pd.DataFrame on the Timestamp column

11-concat.py - Complete the following script to index the pd.DataFrames on the Timestamp columns and concatenate them:
Concatenate the start of the bitstamp table onto the top of the coinbase table
Include all timestamps from bitstamp up to and including timestamp 1417411920
Add keys to the data labeled bitstamp and coinbase respectively

12-hierarchy.py - Based on 11-concat.py, rearrange the MultiIndex levels such that timestamp is the first level:
Concatenate th bitstamp and coinbase tables from timestamps 1417411980 to 1417417980, inclusive
Add keys to the data labeled bitstamp and coinbase respectively
Display the rows in chronological order

13-analyze.py - Complete the following script to calculate descriptive statistics for all columns in pd.DataFrame except Timestamp

14-visualize.py - Complete the following script to visualize the pd.DataFrame:
Plot the data from 2017 and beyond at daily intervals
The column Weighted_Price should be removed
Rename the column Timestamp to Date
Convert the timestamp values to date values
Index the data frame on Date
Missing values in High, Low, Open, and Close should be set to the previous row’s Close value
Missing values in Volume_(BTC) and Volume_(Currency) should be set to 0
