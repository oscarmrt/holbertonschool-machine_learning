This project is about 0x05. Advanced Linear Algebra
0-determinant.py - Write a function def determinant(matrix): that calculates the determinant of a matrix:
matrix is a list of lists whose determinant should be calculated
If matrix is not a list of lists, raise a TypeError with the message matrix must be a list of lists
If matrix is not square, raise a ValueError with the message matrix must be a square matrix
The list [[]] represents a 0x0 matrix
Returns: the determinant of matrix

1-minor.py - Write a function def minor(matrix): that calculates the minor matrix of a matrix:
matrix is a list of lists whose minor matrix should be calculated
If matrix is not a list of lists, raise a TypeError with the message matrix must be a list of lists
If matrix is not square or is empty, raise a ValueError with the message matrix must be a non-empty square matrix
Returns: the minor matrix of matrix

2-cofactor.py - Write a function def cofactor(matrix): that calculates the cofactor matrix of a matrix:
matrix is a list of lists whose cofactor matrix should be calculated
If matrix is not a list of lists, raise a TypeError with the message matrix must be a list of lists
If matrix is not square or is empty, raise a ValueError with the message matrix must be a non-empty square matrix
Returns: the cofactor matrix of matrix

3-adjugate.py - Write a function def adjugate(matrix): that calculates the adjugate matrix of a matrix:
matrix is a list of lists whose adjugate matrix should be calculated
If matrix is not a list of lists, raise a TypeError with the message matrix must be a list of lists
If matrix is not square or is empty, raise a ValueError with the message matrix must be a non-empty square matrix
Returns: the adjugate matrix of matrix

4-inverse.py - Write a function def inverse(matrix): that calculates the inverse of a matrix:
matrix is a list of lists whose inverse should be calculated
If matrix is not a list of lists, raise a TypeError with the message matrix must be a list of lists
If matrix is not square or is empty, raise a ValueError with the message matrix must be a non-empty square matrix
Returns: the inverse of matrix, or None if matrix is singular

5-definiteness.py - Write a function def definiteness(matrix): that calculates the definiteness of a matrix:
matrix is a numpy.ndarray of shape (n, n) whose definiteness should be calculated
If matrix is not a numpy.ndarray, raise a TypeError with the message matrix must be a numpy.ndarray
If matrix is not a valid matrix, return None
Return: the string Positive definite, Positive semi-definite, Negative semi-definite, Negative definite, or Indefinite if the matrix is positive definite, positive semi-definite, negative semi-definite, negative definite of indefinite, respectively
If matrix does not fit any of the above categories, return None
You may import numpy as np
