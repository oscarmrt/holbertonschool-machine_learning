This project is about 0x07. Bayesian Probability
0-likelihood.py - You are conducting a study on a revolutionary cancer drug and are looking to find the probability that a patient who takes this drug will develop severe side effects. During your trials, n patients take the drug and x patients develop severe side effects. You can assume that x follows a binomial distribution.
Write a function def likelihood(x, n, P): that calculates the likelihood of obtaining this data given various hypothetical probabilities of developing severe side effects:
x is the number of patients that develop severe side effects
n is the total number of patients observed
P is a 1D numpy.ndarray containing the various hypothetical probabilities of developing severe side effects
If n is not a positive integer, raise a ValueError with the message n must be a positive integer
If x is not an integer that is greater than or equal to 0, raise a ValueError with the message x must be an integer that is greater than or equal to 0
If x is greater than n, raise a ValueError with the message x cannot be greater than n
If P is not a 1D numpy.ndarray, raise a TypeError with the message P must be a 1D numpy.ndarray
If any value in P is not in the range [0, 1], raise a ValueError with the message All values in P must be in the range [0, 1]
Returns: a 1D numpy.ndarray containing the likelihood of obtaining the data, x and n, for each probability in P, respectively

1-intersection.py - Based on 0-likelihood.py, write a function def intersection(x, n, P, Pr): that calculates the intersection of obtaining this data with the various hypothetical probabilities:
x is the number of patients that develop severe side effects
n is the total number of patients observed
P is a 1D numpy.ndarray containing the various hypothetical probabilities of developing severe side effects
Pr is a 1D numpy.ndarray containing the prior beliefs of P
If n is not a positive integer, raise a ValueError with the message n must be a positive integer
If x is not an integer that is greater than or equal to 0, raise a ValueError with the message x must be an integer that is greater than or equal to 0
If x is greater than n, raise a ValueError with the message x cannot be greater than n
If P is not a 1D numpy.ndarray, raise a TypeError with the message P must be a 1D numpy.ndarray
If Pr is not a numpy.ndarray with the same shape as P, raise a TypeError with the message Pr must be a numpy.ndarray with the same shape as P
If any value in P or Pr is not in the range [0, 1], raise a ValueError with the message All values in {P} must be in the range [0, 1] where {P} is the incorrect variable
If Pr does not sum to 1, raise a ValueError with the message Pr must sum to 1 Hint: use numpy.isclose
All exceptions should be raised in the above order
Returns: a 1D numpy.ndarray containing the intersection of obtaining x and n with each probability in P, respectively

2-marginal.py - Based on 1-intersection.py, write a function def marginal(x, n, P, Pr): that calculates the marginal probability of obtaining the data:
x is the number of patients that develop severe side effects
n is the total number of patients observed
P is a 1D numpy.ndarray containing the various hypothetical probabilities of patients developing severe side effects
Pr is a 1D numpy.ndarray containing the prior beliefs about P
If n is not a positive integer, raise a ValueError with the message n must be a positive integer
If x is not an integer that is greater than or equal to 0, raise a ValueError with the message x must be an integer that is greater than or equal to 0
If x is greater than n, raise a ValueError with the message x cannot be greater than n
If P is not a 1D numpy.ndarray, raise a TypeError with the message P must be a 1D numpy.ndarray
If Pr is not a numpy.ndarray with the same shape as P, raise a TypeError with the message Pr must be a numpy.ndarray with the same shape as P
If any value in P or Pr is not in the range [0, 1], raise a ValueError with the message All values in {P} must be in the range [0, 1] where {P} is the incorrect variable
If Pr does not sum to 1, raise a ValueError with the message Pr must sum to 1
All exceptions should be raised in the above order
Returns: the marginal probability of obtaining x and n

3-posterior.py - Based on 2-marginal.py, write a function def posterior(x, n, P, Pr): that calculates the posterior probability for the various hypothetical probabilities of developing severe side effects given the data:
x is the number of patients that develop severe side effects
n is the total number of patients observed
P is a 1D numpy.ndarray containing the various hypothetical probabilities of developing severe side effects
Pr is a 1D numpy.ndarray containing the prior beliefs of P
If n is not a positive integer, raise a ValueError with the message n must be a positive integer
If x is not an integer that is greater than or equal to 0, raise a ValueError with the message x must be an integer that is greater than or equal to 0
If x is greater than n, raise a ValueError with the message x cannot be greater than n
If P is not a 1D numpy.ndarray, raise a TypeError with the message P must be a 1D numpy.ndarray
If Pr is not a numpy.ndarray with the same shape as P, raise a TypeError with the message Pr must be a numpy.ndarray with the same shape as P
If any value in P or Pr is not in the range [0, 1], raise a ValueError with the message All values in {P} must be in the range [0, 1] where {P} is the incorrect variable
If Pr does not sum to 1, raise a ValueError with the message Pr must sum to 1
All exceptions should be raised in the above order
Returns: the posterior probability of each probability in P given x and n, respectively
